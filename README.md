# Flask with nginx and gunicorn on minikube - walkthrough

This repository is my own. If you want to copy what I did, you should change the
docker hub account, from skipperkongen to your own.

Build image (remember `docker login`):

```
./build.sh
```

Run locally in docker:

```
./run-docker.sh
```

Run locally in minikube (remember `minikube start`):

```
./run-minikube.sh
```
